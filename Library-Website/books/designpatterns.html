        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers
          present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously
          undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable
          designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.
          <br>
          <br>


          The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software.
          They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented
          systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software
          development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.
          <br>
          <br>

          Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other
          design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All
          patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code
          that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.
