        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor.
          Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of
          algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is
          relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a
          pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been
          kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

          The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for
          professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and
          randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It
          includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial
          additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called "Divide-and-Conquer"), and an appendix on matrices. It
          features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow
          in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The
          international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide. <br>
